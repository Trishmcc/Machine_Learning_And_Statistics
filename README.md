# Machine_Learning_And_Statistics 

By Trish O'Grady

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks.

The first Jupyter notebook explains what supervised learning is and what classifiactions aglorithmns are.It explores the classification algorithm named Logistic Regression and how it is applied on the iris flower data set.

The second Jupyter notebook includes 5 topics.

1. Newton's Method is used to write a function sqrt(x) to approximate the square root of a floating point number x without using the power operator or a package.
2. Scipy.stats is used to perform a chi-sqaured test to examine if there is evidence of an association between drink preference and biscuit preference.
3. A t-test is performed on the famous penguins data set to investigate whether there is evidence of a significant difference in the body mass of male and female gentoo penguins.
4. The Iris data set is used to suggest whether the setosa class is easily separable from the other two classes. 
5. Principal Component Analysis is performed on the iris data set, reducing the number of dimensions to two.
